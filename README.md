###Triage: a health services patient management application

This project was done as coursework for CSC207 at the University of Toronto.  Version control was originally maintained on an SVN repository and has been migrated to git primarily for archival purposes.

Collaborators on this project were Asher Minden-Webb, Angel You, and Christina Chung.

Requirements "engineering" for the app was provided by the course instructors and thus it does not represent a real-world product.  It was primarily a learning exercise for object-oriented software design and implementation.
